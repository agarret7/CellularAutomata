# Cellular Automata

## Description

A cellular automata that has interestingly stochastic behavior. This was originally meant to be a genetic algorithm with a neural network, but I realized this project is not very well-suited to that. I may attempt to apply machine learning to the physical environment I've set up; I think that I could obtain interesting results. As of now, the project stands as it is.
